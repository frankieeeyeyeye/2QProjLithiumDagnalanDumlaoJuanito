            <h2> INFLATION IN THE PHILIPPINES </h2>
            <p> As the country’s inflation rate settled to its lowest level in 2023 last December, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) assured the public that the government is continuously monitoring prices and inflation risks and implementing measures to protect the purchasing power of Filipino households. The Philippine Statistics Authority reported that inflation for December 2023 further slowed down to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent in November 2023, bringing the full-year average inflation rate to 6.0 percent.
                Inflation for most commodity groups either slowed down or retained their previous rates during the month. However, rice inflation rose to 19.6 percent during the month from 15.8 percent in November 2023. It was also the most significant contributor to December 2023’s inflation with 1.7 percentage points (ppt), followed by food and beverages services and housing rentals with 0.5 ppt each.
            </p> 
            <p> Thus, NEDA Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan emphasized the importance of Executive Order No. 50, which extended the Most Favored Nation (MFN) reduced tariff rates for key agricultural commodities like pork, corn, and rice to ensure sufficient food supply for Filipinos and prevent spikes in prices of these commodities. 
                The deceleration of food inflation in December 2023 was primarily brought about by the faster year-on-year decrease in vegetables, tubers, plantains, cooking bananas and pulses at 9.2 percent during the month from 2.0 percent annual decline in November 2023. The meat and other parts of slaughtered land animals also contributed to the downtrend with a slower inflation rate of 0.2 percent in December 2023 from 0.5 percent in November 2023.
                In addition, oils and fats index recorded faster annual decline at 3.6 percent in December 2023 from an annual decrease of 3.1 percent in the previous month.
